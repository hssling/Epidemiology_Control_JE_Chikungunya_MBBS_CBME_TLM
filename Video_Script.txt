Narrator: "Welcome to this educational video on Japanese Encephalitis (JE) and Chikungunya, two major mosquito-borne diseases in India. As MBBS students, understanding these is crucial for public health. We'll cover epidemiology, symptoms, and control measures with Indian context. Let's dive in!"

### Section 1: Japanese Encephalitis (0:30 - 3:00)

Narrator: "First, Japanese Encephalitis. Caused by JEV, transmitted by Culex tritaeniorhynchus. Endemic in 24 countries, but in India, it's a major issue in states like Uttar Pradesh, Bihar, and Assam. Annual cases ~100,000 globally, high in India, mostly children under 15. Outbreaks during monsoon, linked to rice farming.

Burden: 30% fatality, 30-50% survivors with neurological damage.

Transmission: Mosquito-pig/bird cycle. High in rural India.

Clinical Features: 4-14 days incubation. Mild: fever, headache. Severe: encephalitis, seizures.

Diagnosis: IgM ELISA via IDSP.

Treatment: Supportive, rehabilitation.

Prevention: SA 14-14-2 vaccine in UIP, campaigns in endemic states. NVBDCP fogging, repellents."

### Section 2: Chikungunya (3:00 - 5:30)

Narrator: "Now, Chikungunya, caused by CHIKV, transmitted by Aedes aegypti/albopictus. Global spread, but in India, 2006 outbreak affected 1.3 million in Kerala, Karnataka, Maharashtra. Recent surges in Delhi, Punjab. Monsoon-linked, urban water storage.

Burden: Acute joint pain, chronic disability.

Transmission: Day-biting mosquitoes, human cycle.

Clinical Features: 4-8 days incubation. Fever, severe joint pain, rash. Pain lasts months/years.

Diagnosis: RT-PCR, serology.

Treatment: Paracetamol, rest. Avoid NSAIDs.

Prevention: NVBDCP source reduction, eliminate breeding sites. Ixchiq vaccine under review."

### Section 3: Comparative Analysis (5:30 - 6:30)
[Visual: Comparison table with Indian stats]
Narrator: "Similarities: Both mosquito-borne, prevalent in India, controlled by NVBDCP. Differences: JE - encephalitis, high fatality; Chikungunya - joint pain, chronic."

### Section 4: Control Measures (6:30 - 7:30)
[Visual: NVBDCP icons, vaccination drives]
Narrator: "In India: JE vaccination in UIP, Chikungunya source reduction. Vector control, personal protection. Surveillance via IDSP."

### Conclusion (7:30 - 8:00)
