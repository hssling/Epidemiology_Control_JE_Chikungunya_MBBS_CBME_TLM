# Student Handouts: Epidemiology and Control Measures of JE and Chikungunya (Indian Context)

## Key Points for Japanese Encephalitis (JE)

### Epidemiology
- Vector: *Culex tritaeniorhynchus* mosquito
- Endemic in 24 countries in Asia, major in India (UP, Bihar, Assam)
- Affects >3 billion people
- Annual cases: ~100,000 globally, high in India
- Mostly in children <15 years
- Rural disease, linked to rice farming and monsoon

### Burden
- Case-fatality: 30%
- Sequelae in 30-50% survivors
- 25,000 deaths/year globally, significant in India

### Transmission
- Enzootic cycle: Mosquito → Pig/Bird → Mosquito
- Humans: Dead-end hosts
- High in rural India with agriculture

### Clinical Features
- Incubation: 4-14 days
- Mild: Fever, headache
- Severe: Encephalitis, seizures, paralysis

### Diagnosis
- IgM ELISA on CSF/serum
- Surveillance: Acute encephalitis syndrome via IDSP

### Treatment
- Supportive only
- Rehabilitation for sequelae

### Prevention
- Vaccination: SA 14-14-2 in UIP, campaigns in endemic states
- Vector control: Fogging, larviciding under NVBDCP
- Personal: Repellents, nets

## Key Points for Chikungunya

### Epidemiology
- Vector: *Aedes aegypti/albopictus*
- >110 countries affected, major outbreaks in India (2006: 1.3M cases)
- Urban/rural outbreaks in Delhi, Punjab, Haryana
- Since 2004: Increased spread, monsoon-linked

### Burden
- Acute joint pain
- Chronic disability
- Outbreaks affect millions in India

### Transmission
- Day-biting mosquitoes
- Human → Mosquito → Human
- Urban water storage, rural breeding sites

### Clinical Features
- Incubation: 4-8 days
- Fever, severe joint pain, rash
- Pain lasts weeks/months/years

### Diagnosis
- RT-PCR (first week)
- Serology (later)
- Differentiate from dengue

### Treatment
- Paracetamol, fluids, rest
- Avoid NSAIDs initially

### Prevention
- Bite avoidance
- Vector control: Eliminate breeding sites under NVBDCP
- Vaccines: Ixchiq under review, not widespread

## Comparative Quick Reference
| Aspect | JE | Chikungunya |
|--------|----|-------------|
| Vector | Culex | Aedes |
| Main Symptom | Encephalitis | Joint Pain |
| Fatality | High (30%) | Low |
| Chronic Issue | Neurological | Joint Pain |
| Indian Program | UIP Vaccination | NVBDCP Source Reduction |

## Quiz Questions (Self-Assessment)
1. Primary vector for JE in India?
2. Characteristic of Chikungunya pain?
3. Common prevention for both in India?

Answers: 1. Culex, 2. Debilitating and prolonged, 3. Vector control and personal protection via NVBDCP.
